## Introduction

Stata is a comprehensive statistical software package for data management, analysis, and graphics. It's widely used in research, particularly in the social sciences. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of Stata, including data manipulation, basic statistical analysis, and creating simple graphs.

## Getting Started

When you open Stata, you'll see the main interface, which includes the Command window, the Results window, the Variables window, and the Properties window. You can execute commands directly in the Command window or use do-files (scripts) for reproducibility.

## Loading your dataset

Let's start by loading the census data using the `use` command:

```{stata, cleanlog=FALSE, collectcode = TRUE}
use "http://www.stata-press.com/data/r9/census.dta", clear 
describe
```

The `describe` commmand produces a summary of the dataset in memory or of the data stored in a Stata-format dataset.

## Basic Commands

### Generating new varianles

In Stata, you can create new variables using the `generate` (or `gen` for short) command.

#### Example

```{stata, eval = FALSE}
* Assigning value 10 to variable x
gen x = 10
```


## Understanding Data Types in Stata

Stata handles various data types, including numeric, string, and date. It automatically determines the appropriate type when data is loaded or generated.

### Numeric

Numeric variables in Stata can represent both integers and floating-point numbers.

```{stata, eval=FALSE}
* Defining numeric variables
gen my_integer = 42
gen my_double  = 42.5
```

Different from R, both variables here are "float."

### String

String variables are used for text and are defined using quotes.

```{stata, eval=FALSE}
* Defining a string variable
gen my_string = "Hello, world! I love econometrics!"
```

### Date

Date variables in Stata are numeric, with a specific format applied to display them as dates.

```{stata, eval=FALSE}
* Defining a date variable
gen my_date = date("2024-01-01", "YMD")
format my_date %td
```


## Basic Stata Operations

Stata can perform calculations and data manipulations directly in the command line or through do-files.

```{stata, eval=FALSE}
* Simple calculation
display 2 + 2
```

## Importing Data

To import CSV files in Stata, use the `import delimited` command.

```{stata, eval = FALSE}
* Importing data from CSV
import delimited "path/to/your/file.csv", clear
```

## Using Stata's Commands for Data Manipulation

Stata offers a wide range of commands for data manipulation, including `filter` (conditions for keeping observations), `generate` and `replace` (for creating and modifying variables), and `summarize` (for basic descriptive statistics).

### Summarizing Data

`summarize` provides descriptive statistics for variables.

```{stata, cleanlog=FALSE, output.lines=-(1:5)}
* Summarizing population
summarize pop
```


### Filtering Data

In Stata, you use `keep` if or `drop` if to filter data.

```{stata, cleanlog=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
* Dropping only observations from California
drop if state == "California"
```

### Modifying Variables

Use `generate` to create new variables and `replace` to modify existing ones.

```{stata, cleanlog=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
* Creating a new variable
replace state = "MA" if state == "California"
```

## Graphing

The `scatter` command, for example, is used for scatterplots and line graphs.


```{stata, cleanlog=FALSE, echo=1:2, results="hide"}
* Creating a simple scatterplot
scatter pop death
quietly graph export scatter.svg, replace
```

![Pop ~ Death](scatter.svg)

## Getting Help

Stata has a comprehensive help system accessible through the `help` command.

```{stata, cleanlog=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
* Getting help on the summarize command
help summarize
```


```{r cleanup, include=FALSE}
unlink("scatter.svg")
```
